# copy-mybatis-statement

## System Requirements

* IDE: Intellij IDEA
* Persistence Technology: MyBatis

## Features

In the console of the IDEA development tool, a menu Copy MyBatis Statement is added. When the project uses MyBatis as the persistence technology, the execution log will be used to display the executed SQL statement in the console in the development environment.
As long as the output SQL statement is selected, right-clicking on this menu will automatically populate the SQL placeholder with parameters and set it in the clipboard.
